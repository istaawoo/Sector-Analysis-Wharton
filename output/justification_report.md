## Methodology Notes

PRISM scores are computed as:
- **Structural (35%)**: Porter's 5 Forces + Industry Life Cycle
- **Fundamentals (30%)**: Market-cap weighted firm metrics (ROE, margins, FCF, debt)
- **Market Behavior (20%)**: Returns, volatility, drawdown, beta
- **Top-Down (15%)**: Country GDP growth, GDP per capita, SWOT analysis

Tier definitions:
- **Overweight**: PRISM ≥ 70 — Strong opportunity, recommended overweight
- **Neutral**: PRISM 55-69 — Moderate opportunity, neutral weight
- **Underweight**: PRISM < 55 — Lower opportunity, consider underweight
- **Not Scored**: ETFs and diversified holdings
